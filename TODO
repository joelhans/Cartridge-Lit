[ ][ ] - Kill the 6-by-6 format, go with two big images 50%/50%, overlayed 

[ ][ ] - Top navigation bar that floats.
  - Fiction/poetry/nonfiction links as well.
  - On hover, there's a dropdown like Terrain.org. Images and titles.

[ ][ ] - Come up with some way to vertically align titles/meta?

[ ][ ] - Previous/next buttons, or other recent content after a story.
  - Maybe just have a sidebar on the stories, too?
  - I don't know. :(

[ ][ ] - Make a little magnifying glass that reveals more info on the image.

[ ][ ] - Better breakpoints.

# BUGS

[ ][ ] - On all pages, make it so the images are actual images, not background images. That should help with SEO/grabbing from feeds.
