Top navigation bar that floats.
  - Fiction/poetry/nonfiction links as well.
  - On hover, there's a dropdown like Terrain.org. Images and titles.

Come up with some way to vertically align titles/meta?

Previous/next buttons, or other recent content after a story.
  - Maybe just have a sidebar on the stories, too?
  - I don't know. :(

Better breakpoints.
