    <h1>Everything Makes a Noise <br />When it Reveals Itself</h1>

      Everyone keeps trying to give me this daughter. She has been in<br />
      my house, but she did not come with me. I am following her<br />
      around the top of a town I think is the whole town. Even the<br />
      river is just a surface. A street down which I look both ways.<br />
      The solid ground, the stone floor of the church, each drawn on<br />
      rock is a hint she leaves. The basement is a darkness you don’t<br />
      even know is there. I touch my forehead with two fingers.<br />
      Everything I can feel right now is mine.

      The town is burnt &amp; they live in the ash-blacked walls like<br />
      nurses. They pace back &amp; forth by the bed, weeping. Each one<br />
      holds the knife she entered with. Each one trails the bandage,<br />
      wedded to the building &amp; the secret fire beneath. The hospital<br />
      is all flesh &amp; the barbed wire of knowing what you’ve done. The<br />
      nurses sob without a sound, blood that spills out like breath.<br />
      Nothing is burning now.

      In my walking dreams I dreamed this town &amp; you promised it<br />
      to me. I dreamed this lake &amp; these pines &amp; these buildings too,<br />
      though the sun touched them when I dreamed. When I woke up<br />
      from walking I was alone in the town, but the town had rusted<br />
      under the endless ash-fall of night. I took your wallet. It was the<br />
      smallest thing I could be sure you’d come after. That’s what<br />
      you’re going to face the dead for. It’s not rust that covers the<br />
      town, it’s blood. It’s not blood, it’s the sound of the town<br />
      burning every time it snows.

      At the gates I wish I could make you go back. You simply push<br />
      the gate aside. That scraping sound is everywhere. The town<br />
      is setting itself up behind you. It creates the past as you walk<br />
      down this hall. It looked like a hall but now it’s an office.<br />
      It looked like an office but it’s another jail.

      A hole appears. The hole is another kind of trap. He tries his<br />
      hand at the knife, the light, the rescue. All the women wail. You<br />
      are following a shadow that bleeds. At the end of the road is a<br />
      tunnel. At the end of the tunnel is a room. You can’t leave the<br />
      room. That’s the way these holes work.

      We want to know what the dream is. You dream that the room<br />
      is a film &amp; light burns the room back into what it was before.<br />
      Someone calls you on the phone &amp; tells you to save them.<br />
      They have a token, they say, if you need it.

      The flashlight is an umbrella &amp; a beacon: it splints the weak<br />
      wrist but the darkness nurses in your direction. You want to<br />
      ask everyone you see what is going on but everyone you see is<br />
      screaming. No one can read the sign on the ground, no one can<br />
      help me get out of this building, no one can tell me the name of<br />
      the girls hanging in perfectly arranged rows.

      When you said anything you didn’t mean these: bound at the<br />
      waist &amp; backs split open. They stand up &amp; stand up. Stay on the<br />
      road, they say. This is the road, they say: come to me. The map<br />
      is real, like something I’ve only just learned how to pronounce.

      You turn in time with the memorized map till you reach a wall<br />
      made entirely of nurses: gouged out faces beneath the bandage.<br />
      They are alive in the light &amp; want to put an end to it.
    </p>
  </article>

    <p>
      There are hooks in the flesh of the floor. Up &amp; down on the<br />
      chain like carousel horses. The pretty paint, the skirted legs.<br />
      You point the flashlight forward but turn back. The legs are<br />
      twitching. Or shivering. The nurses are the dark. They crowd<br />
      out the light with their blindness. They are shivering their<br />
      skin off so it will not have to know what follows.

      It’s a ghost that runs away, it’s a ghost and not those pink little<br />
      girls with their backs all sewed up, it’s a ghost that plays the<br />
      child’s toy. Listen. There has to be a clue in the song. There is<br />
      always a song that solves something. The keys are animals:<br />
      bears for the bear that’s chained to the ceiling, birds for the<br />
      bird &amp; the shovel, dogs for the incessant barking of the snow.

      They show me a picture of a girl who is not my daughter.<br />
      Everyone is furious. She cannot belong to me because too much<br />
      time has passed. In which none of them has changed. There is<br />
      something we all don’t understand about my daughter.

      You watch her mouth move but the name of the town is silent &amp;<br />
      everything in the town is named after the town. The painting<br />
      where it burns doesn’t say a thing. You watch her mouth move<br />
      but the water covers it up.

      In the water the blood is a dye &amp; when you want to see<br />
      the message you use the water like a bleach to eat away at<br />
      everything that is not the message.

      They are going grey and slack in there &amp; no one pushes food<br />
      into the grates, no one pushes water into the grates &amp; the water<br />
      comes down from the ceiling &amp; it washes their bodies right<br />
      through the hole &amp; they are too dead to notice the other<br />
      children coming down the hole.

      The pool is drained but the baby carriage is still in the center.<br />
      The children are slow to starve. Their ribs make a dry pool<br />
      beneath their caved-in mouths. There is a treasure made of<br />
      metal in the carriage. Run. They bend back. They are trying to<br />
      spread their ribs like wings. They are taking a very deep<br />
      breath. They are trying to blind you with what comes next.

      The ladder is a symbol for the fire to run up: there is counting<br />
      for anticipation. How much worse the heat than the fire, how<br />
      you plan to breathe your lungs away before your skin. It’s just a<br />
      guess. Never the rope, where it burns &amp; slips; instead the metal<br />
      clamp, the palm that never recovers. &amp; who is left to see it: sack<br />
      on a stepladder.

      She saunters along behind you. Just a dream, she says. You<br />
      think she’s dreamed herself the wrong shoes. She thinks she’s<br />
      dreamed her voice into a new animal. &amp; a terrible one. Might as<br />
      well have some fun. She is going to try to seduce you when all<br />
      she has left is hair, long hair that covers the ghost of her body &amp;<br />
      you are going to pin her to the ground with obedience, yes.<br />
    </p>

      You watch what is left of a woman come through the thin skin <br />
      of the wall. She shakes &amp; crawls. Both of you count the tiles that <br />
      separate you, but come to different conclusions. It’s hard to <br />
      know what you are so afraid of. All she wants is to get up into <br />
      the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s you. &amp; you are really trying.
