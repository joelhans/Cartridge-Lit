    <p class="pp-indent-4">A fist is capricious; the heart: more so.
	  <p class="pp-indent-1">Show me what's inside of you &amp; how you can live without it. </p>
		<p class="pp-indent-2">Here; the ground below each tree: it secrets a prison of roots. </p>
		<p class="pp-indent-3">In my own veins (even after so many times) I faint <br />
       whenever a hand draws the blood.</p>
    <p class="pp-indent-4">Let it be your hand: take this pen, this pin; <br />
       make me swoon &amp; do it soon (I cannot cannot cannot wait).</p>
    <p class="pp-indent-5">The heart beats; pushes.</p>
    <p class="pp-indent-6">All living is violence.</p>
		<p class="pp-indent-2">Above and below, a dusting of dusk deepens the stars-- to <br />
       this purple &amp; this soft, i ask: <em>deliver me into the sadnesses of the worlds</em>.</p>

    <h1>The medical arcades</h1>
    <p>look up, the stars are moving <br />
       away from you. the earthshined</p>
    <p>moon, too. injured men float on <br />
       beds. they try to stay silent</p>
    <p>but they breathe &amp; their breath sounds<br />
       drowned, washed up on the shores</p>
    <p>of their lips. gibbous under <br />
       the machine light. i curl. people</p>
    <p>don't visit but i forget <br />
       not to talk. our heartbeats</p>
    <p>distilled to a thin, constant, <br />
       pinging. no one's coming.</p>

    <h1>Beware I live, I hunger</h1>
    <p class="pp-indent-4">A face hewn from the sky.</p>
    <p>The stars twinkle like a dead man's eyes. </p>
    <p class="pp-indent-7">A shard of light lays <br />
       on the floor, jagging from beneath the door.</p>
    <p class="pp-indent-1">Some have fire, or brightness hidden inside of them-- secret galaxies <br />
       inside tummies; bones milky with night.</p>
    <p class="pp-indent-6">A room filled with light is as full <br />
       as one filled without.</p>

       Hands sharpen.</p>

    <h1>Modeling, geometrically</h1>
    <p>as a child; a man explained to me <br />
       that the body was nothing but inter-</p>
    <p>secting vertices all wrapped in skin, <br />
       holding a hollow within: a wire-framed coop</p>
    <p>to protect the chicken Dickinson once <br />
       called soul. &amp; all that was inside anyone was</p>
    <p>wind &amp; spirit &amp; whatever else passed <br />
       through it. maybe this is why everything</p>
    <p>feels whole &amp; lonely. i believed him, then. <br />
       now, i've learned that there are bones i cannot</p>
    <p>see (not easily): but i trust that there is <br />
       a skeleton inside of me &amp; that it</p>
    <p>is always smiling. myself? i'd have been <br />

    <h1>The Chase</h1>
    <p>Ghosts or haints. </p>
    <p class="pp-indent-5">A haunt is another word for a face; <br />
       scary to see so many floating through the world.</p>
    <p class="pp-indent-3">Alive &amp; dead &amp; asleep, bodies ache to press against <br />
       something new. </p>
    <p class="pp-indent-1 pp-justify">The ghosts want this too, but they can't keep up; there are too many; <br />
       they bump into each other-- no matter how much they try, they can't find a <br />
       way to forget themselves.</p>
    <p class="pp-indent-2">Do you know what it's like for your ghosts to tire of you?</p>
    <p>Alone with her, he pretends to be the ghost of someone she once loved; <br />
       next: she plays at haunting him.</p>
    <p class="pp-indent-5">They take turns; they call this <em>love</em>.</p>
    <p class="pp-indent-3">Each home is a maze; each waits for one person to <br />
       chase another through it.</p>

    <h1>Healing potion</h1>
    <p>there are places where you mention your injuries, <br />
       i've heard, &amp; they will be healed. but not here.</p>
     <p>here, make a secret of your sickness. if someone asks  <br />
        about your health, they aren't asking</p>
    <p>b/c they can help. old men &amp; robes &amp; rest  <br />
       in inns won't cure anything. in bed he asks,</p>
    <p>after looking in your medicine cabinet,  <br />
       <em>what's wrong with you</em> &amp; you explain the days</p>
    <p>where you'd crawl around your house b/c you couldn't  <br />
       walk. how difficult it still is to go anywhere, especially</p>
    <p><em>out</em>. the melody of bearable pains is strange  <br />
       until it's the only song you know. be me:</p>
    <p>be dumb, &amp; think, maybe, he'll understand.  <br />
