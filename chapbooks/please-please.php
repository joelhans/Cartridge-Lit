    <h1>Watch out the heart attacks</h1>
    <p>A fist is capricious; the heart: more so.
	  <p class="pp-indent-1">Show me what's inside of you & how you can live without it. </p>
		<p class="pp-indent-2">Here; the ground below each tree: it secrets a prison of roots. </p>
		<p class="pp-indent-3">In my own veins (even after so many times) I faint <br />
    whenever a hand draws the blood.</p>
    <p>Let it be your hand: take this pen, this pin; <br />
    make me swoon & do it soon (I cannot cannot cannot wait).</p>
    <p>The heart beats; pushes.</p>
    <p>All living is violence.</p>
		<p>Above and below, a dusting of dusk deepens the stars-- to <br />
    this purple & this soft, i ask: <em>deliver me into the sadnesses of the worlds</em>.</p>

    <h1>The medical arcades</h1>
    <p>look up, the stars are moving <br />
    away from you. the earthshined</p>
    <p>moon, too. injured men float on <br />
    beds. they try to stay silent</p>
    <p>but they breathe & their breath sounds<br />
    drowned, washed up on the shores</p>
    <p>of their lips. gibbous under <br />
    the machine light. i curl. people</p>
    <p>don't visit but i forget <br />
    not to talk. our heartbeats</p>
    <p>distilled to a thin, constant, <br />
    pinging. no one's coming.</p>
    <p>when i died, the stars were close.<br />
    but i'm back, & now they're gone.</p>

    <h1>Beware I live, I hunger</h1>
    <p>A face hewn from the sky.</p>
    <p>The stars twinkle like a dead man's eyes. </p>
    <p>A shard of light lays <br />
    on the floor, jagging from beneath the door.</p>
    <p>	Some have fire, or brightness hidden inside of them-- secret galaxies <br />
    inside tummies; bones milky with night.</p>
    <p>A room filled with light is as full as one filled without.</p>
    <p>The sky grows barren. <br />
    Hands sharpen.</p>
    <p>I notice the body, <em>my</em> body, for the first time, as a <br />
    burden.</p>

    <h1>Modeling, geometrically</h1>
    <p>as a child; a man explained to me <br />
    that the body was nothing but inter-</p>
    <p>secting vertices all wrapped in skin, <br />
    holding a hollow within: a wire-framed coop</p>
    <p>to protect the chicken Dickinson once <br />
    called soul. & all that was inside anyone was</p>
    <p>wind & spirit & whatever else passed <br />
    through it. maybe this is why everything</p>
    <p>feels whole & lonely. i believed him, then. <br />
       now, i've learned that there are bones i cannot</p>
    <p>see (not easily): but i trust that there is <br />
       a skeleton inside of me & that it</p>
    <p>is always smiling. myself? i'd have been <br />
       happier to've been the wind, passing through.</p>

    <h1>The Chase</h1>
    <p>Ghosts or haints. </p>
    <p>A haunt is another word for a face; <br />
       scary to see so many floating through the world.</p>
    <p>Alive & dead & asleep, bodies ache to press against <br />
       something new. </p>
    <p>The ghosts want this too, but they can't keep up; there are too many; <br />
       they bump into each other-- no matter how much they try, they can't find a <br />
       way to forget themselves.</p>
    <p>Do you know what it's like for your ghosts to tire of you?</p>
    <p>Alone with her, he pretends to be the ghost of someone she once loved; <br />
       next: she plays at haunting him.</p>
    <p>They take turns; they call this <em>love</em>.</p>
    <p>Each home is a maze; each waits for one person to <br />
       chase another through it.</p>

    <h1>Healing potion</h1>
    <p>there are places where you mention your injuries,
       i've heard, & they will be healed. but not here.</p>
     <p>here, make a secret of your sickness. if someone asks
        about your health, they aren't asking</p>
    <p>b/c they can help. old men & robes & rest
       in inns won't cure anything. in bed he asks,</p>
    <p>after looking in your medicine cabinet,
       what's wrong with you & you explain the days</p>
    <p>where you'd crawl around your house b/c you couldn't
       walk. how difficult it still is to go anywhere, especially</p>
    <p>out. the melody of bearable pains is strange
       until it's the only song you know. be me:</p>
    <p>be dumb, & think, maybe, he'll understand.
       then, him: ... ... , ...-- are you contagious?</p>

    <h1>They meet</h1>
    <p>She falls in love with a blank. </p>
    <p>He has no eyes; hers are blue. </p>
    <p>He has no lips; hers are red. </p>
    <p>She wears a mole, a ribbon: all body and mouth. </p>
    <p>The dead follow them. </p>
    <p>Children following a circle of breadcrumbs. </p>
    <p>An entrance becomes an exit: a tunnel pitched out of the body.</p>
    <p>All paths lead back, back, retracing the same paths.</p>

    <h1>you can use a bullet to make a meat</h1>
    <p>you can use a face to bring yourself back
       to life. you can throw a knife & it will</p>
    <p>fly forever, parallel to the sharp
       razor of the horizon. you can kill</p>
    <p>a man & his body will vanish. you
       can attack a wall & reveal a whole</p>
    <p>roasted turkey. & if you eat it, you will
       recover from your (invisible) wounds.</p>
    <p>you can go to your job, go to your home;
       you can screw or drink or collect money;</p>
    <p>you can have children & watch them leave or
       die or stay. you can drive out to the beach</p>
    <p>& back, crying, (& salt stains on your lips).
       how can you find all of this to be fun?</p>

    <h1>Junior</h1>
    <p>Children fall from the sky, abandoned by the birds.</p>
    <p>Earless and armless, smiling (liplessly), they keep falling. </p>
    <p>Every child is male and small and they stare at their parents and their <br />
       parents stare right back. </p>
    <p>Their name is a rank, a title: not even a name. </p>
    <p>Sons keeps dropping. </p>
    <p>There's a moment when every parent considers eating <br />
       their children; either out of love or loneliness or both.</p>
    <p>Not one of them ever meets his brother. </p>
    <p>Above, a continual line of white birds disappear into the <br />
       black of the horizon.</p>

    <h1>Speak to the villagers</h1>
    <p>you rarely hear your own voice & when you do,
       your thoughts aren't your own. strangers</p>
    <p>repeat themselves; out of words, they nod,
       punctuate the silence <em>... ... ...!</em></p>
    <p>but what do you have to say that's so important
       anyway? you call your mother; don't tell her</p>
    <p>about your lovers, feelings, failures b/c
       she has her own to hide. our dramatic routines.</p>
    <p>have you noticed your own dull loop yet?
       you take the bus to work. it takes you home.</p>
    <p>weather changes. the same faces appear
       on different bodies. close to the familiar. the villagers</p>
    <p>repeat what they hear & you talk to them, repeating
       the same dialogue with each new person you meet.</p>

    <h1>The empty room</h1>
    <p>is empty. which you should've known. but why, & why <br />
       fill it? you open an unknown door & find the room</p>
    <p>where you touched a boy's face & he punched yours. <br />
       open another & there's the abandoned factory office</p>
    <p>where you lived when you were fifteen-- where you <br />
       drank & slept & laminated a photograph</p>
    <p>of a handsome dead boy in packing tape & didn't <br />
       speak to anyone for months. where you first felt</p>
    <p>safe. & now all rooms look the same. you go home <br />
       & find the emptiness behind the furniture. outside:</p>
    <p>the blankness behind each crowd. even when <br />
       you kiss a man, you only notice the hollow he's hidden</p>
    <p>in his mouth. you find yourself--  but the only promise <br />
       is the ground; a promise you can ful & fill.</p>

    <h1>All of time and space and the space outside of space where does it end</h1>
    <p>Turn around until you're facing the ground: open it.</p>
    <p>Behind you are the <br />
       ruins of the sky & between you & another sky is the ground. </p>
    <p>If you could <br />
       see the future you'd run towards memory. </p>
    <p>No one can see the future <br />
       clearly; the past & the present too, as if it mattered.</p>
    <p>But still, there are <br />
       inevitabilities.</p>
    <p>You will die. </p>
    <p>This will all continue, with or without you.</p>
    <p>The sky forgets everyone; <br />
       love it anyway.</p>

    <h1>i break into my friends houses when they're gone</h1>
    <p>through the kitchen light of alleys, all akimbo, <br />
      i go (slowly). strangers leave their windows</p>
    <p>open, their doors unbolted, all for me, <br />
      so i can take baths with oil pearls & smell</p>
    <p>like the gardens at the bottom of the <br />
      sea. in their beds, i use their pillows &</p>
    <p>dream that i'll dream the same dreams that they dreamed <br />
      the night before. i wear their shirts, their dresses</p>
    <p>& try to forget that all of my friends <br />
      are dead. their hearts unlocked; the relentless</p>
    <p>earth ransacking the corners of their bodies, <br />
      then taking everything for itself. my only home</p>

    <h1>Please choose two other kids</h1>
    <p>Boys over-ripen as the summer deepens. </p>
    <p>A dusting of dusk hangs in the stars-- mostly purplish and softing into the <br />
       canopies of the oaks.</p>
    <p>Planes trouble the evening; drones moreso. </p>
    <p>Satellites collect the tailings of the afternoon; shine for a wish's minute, then <br />
       vanish. </p>
    <p>Night: proof that everything moves away from everything else.</p>
    <p>You have to cross an infinity of halves before you even can hold someone <br />

       (which you probably already knew). so.</p>

       heartbreak. there are people who make a game</p>
    <p>of romance without ever knowing anyone. <br />
       but you've done this before & you know</p>
