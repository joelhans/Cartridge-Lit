Take away navigation TOC width. Take away the <a>'s left: 30 and give them 2rem
margins on the left and right.

Figure out how to make the navigation TOC work on small screens. Scrollbar?

The "HERE THE FRAME RATE CHUGS" isn't aligned-left properly against the tree.
Not sure how to fix this. Attach the image to the container and push it left?

For "EVIL DOES NOT WORK" make it so that the text is always centered where the
circle is.
